# rgb-squad

## TODO

### MVP
- [ ] Simple environment - single room
- [ ] Player (square) that can move around with the arrow keys (see twenty/roguelike)
- [ ] The player can change colour with ASD (RGB)
- [ ] Stationary turrets (squares) that shoot non-functional bullets at the player (see crypt-guardians)
- [ ] The turrets have a colour, as well as their bullets
- [ ] The bullets pass through the player if they have the same colour and collide otherwise (maybe there should be 6 collision layers - 3 for the player, 3 for the enemies)
- [ ] :skull: `[LOSE STATE]` When hit, the player loses hp; when at 0hp, the player loses
- [ ] The player can shoot too
- [ ] Endless automatically generated rooms (see twenty/roguelike)
- [ ] Score = rooms cleared

### Main features
- [ ] Hi-scores
- [ ] Player sprite
- [ ] Enemy sprites
- [ ] Enemies with melee attacks
- [ ] 3 player characters (R = shotgun/fire, G = laser, B = melee)
- [ ] The 3 player characters have their own health bars
- [ ] Random upgrades, specific to every player kind
- [ ] More enemy types with harder to dodge attacks

### Additional features
- [ ] :checkered_flag: `[WIN STATE]` A non-endless mode where the player must collect 3 keys
- [ ] Minimap
- [ ] Every key is guarded by a boss
- [ ] Checkpoints (for the non-endless mode)

### Potential features
- [ ] Predefined dialogue between the player and the bosses

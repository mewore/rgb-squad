# rgb-squad

## TODO

- [x] The player can change colour with ASD (RGB)
- [x] Stationary turrets (squares) that shoot non-functional bullets at the player (see crypt-guardians)
- [x] The turrets have a colour, as well as their bullets
- [x] The bullets pass through the player if they have the same colour and collide otherwise (maybe there should be 6 collision layers - 3 for the player, 3 for the enemies)
